## HERO SECTION

### Current Version
**Headline:** Your Business Has Untapped Potential. Let's Find It.

**Lead:** You've built something real. But somewhere between the daily grind and the big picture, growth stalled. Revenue plateaued. And that nagging feeling won't go away: there has to be a better way.

**Value Prop:** There is. Most consultants see your business through one lens. Marketing or finance or technology, but rarely all three. I've spent 30 years mastering all of them. From FTSE 100 boardrooms to owner-managed scale-ups, I've learned that breakthrough growth happens at the intersection. That's where I work.

---

### Alternative A: The Straight Shooter
**Headline:** I Help Business Owners Make More Money. Properly.

**Lead:** No fluff. No frameworks you'll forget next week. Just thirty years of experience finding what's broken and fixing it. Marketing. Finance. AI. Whatever's holding you back.

**Value Prop:** Here's what I've noticed after three decades: the best opportunities hide where disciplines overlap. Your marketing person doesn't read your P&L. Your accountant doesn't understand customer acquisition. I do both. That's the difference.

---

### Alternative B: The Problem Agitator
**Headline:** Stuck at the Same Revenue for Two Years? There's a Reason.

**Lead:** You've tried the tactics. Hired the agencies. Sat through the strategy days. Yet here you are, still grinding for the same results. The problem isn't effort. It's that nobody's looking at the whole picture.

**Value Prop:** Growth doesn't stall because of one thing. It stalls because marketing, finance, and operations are pulling in different directions. I've spent thirty years learning to see all three at once. That's how you find the moves everyone else misses.

---

### Alternative C: The Quiet Confidence
**Headline:** What If Your Business Could Grow Without Working Harder?

**Lead:** There's usually a simpler path. One that doesn't require more hours, more staff, or more stress. Just clearer thinking about what actually drives growth in your specific situation.

**Value Prop:** I bring an unusual combination: I started in finance at GSK, moved into marketing, and now build AI systems. That odd journey means I spot opportunities that specialists walk right past. Most of my best ideas come from applying something that works in one discipline to a problem in another.

---

### Alternative D: The Challenger
**Headline:** Your Marketing Agency Won't Tell You This.

**Lead:** They're great at tactics. But they don't understand your margins. They don't know which customers actually make you money. And they definitely won't tell you when you're wasting budget on campaigns that look good but don't convert.

**Value Prop:** I'm not an agency. I'm an operator who happens to know marketing, finance, and AI. Which means I can tell you the truth: what's working, what isn't, and where your money should actually go. Even when that truth is uncomfortable.

---

### Alternative E: The Question Hook
**Headline:** What's the One Thing Holding Your Business Back?

**Lead:** It's rarely what you think. Most owners blame marketing, or the team, or the economy. But after thirty years of diagnosing businesses, I've found the real blockers hide in the gaps between departments. The places nobody owns.

**Value Prop:** I work across marketing, finance, and AI because that's where the problems live. And the opportunities. One conversation is usually enough to spot what's been invisible to everyone else.

---

### Alternative F: The Insider
**Headline:** I've Sat in Rooms You Haven't. Here's What I Learned.

**Lead:** FTSE 100 boardrooms. Private equity deal tables. Owner-managed businesses trying to scale. The problems look different, but the patterns are the same. Growth stalls when the people running marketing, finance, and operations stop talking to each other.

**Value Prop:** I've spent thirty years translating between these worlds. Now I help business owners see their company the way a buyer would, a board would, or a growth investor would. That perspective changes everything.

---

### Alternative G: The Confession
**Headline:** I Used to Think Marketing Was the Answer to Everything.

**Lead:** Then I trained as an accountant and realised half my campaigns were losing money. Then I learned AI and realised half my processes were wasting time. Every new skill showed me how little I knew before.

**Value Prop:** Now I don't believe in silver bullets. I believe in looking at the whole business, finding the real constraint, and fixing that first. It's less exciting than a new marketing funnel. It works better.

---

### Alternative H: The Filter
**Headline:** This Isn't for Everyone. And That's the Point.

**Lead:** If you're looking for quick wins or magic tactics, we're not a fit. I work with business owners who've built something real and want to build it bigger. People who can handle honest feedback. People who do the work.

**Value Prop:** In return, you get thirty years of experience across marketing, finance, and AI. No sugarcoating. No vanity metrics. Just clear thinking about what will actually grow your business, and help making it happen.

---

### Alternative I: The Observation
**Headline:** Most Businesses Are Leaving Money on the Table. Yours Probably Is Too.

**Lead:** Not because you're doing anything wrong. Because you're too close to see it. The pricing that could be higher. The customers that cost more than they're worth. The processes that worked three years ago but don't anymore.

**Value Prop:** Fresh eyes help. Especially eyes that understand marketing, finance, and technology well enough to see where they connect. That's what I bring: thirty years of pattern recognition applied to your specific situation.

---

### Alternative J: The Before and After
**Headline:** Imagine Knowing Exactly Where Your Next 20% Growth Will Come From.

**Lead:** Not hoping. Knowing. Having a clear picture of which customers to focus on, which products to push, and which activities to stop doing entirely. That clarity exists. Most businesses just haven't found it yet.

**Value Prop:** I help business owners find it. Through marketing strategy, financial analysis, and increasingly through AI systems that surface insights you'd never spot manually. The combination is unusual. The results speak for themselves.

---

### Alternative K: The Origin Story
**Headline:** I Started as a Bean Counter. That Turned Out to Be an Advantage.

**Lead:** My first job was crunching numbers at GSK. Hardly glamorous. But it taught me something most marketers never learn: how to tell which campaigns actually make money. That skill has shaped everything since.

**Value Prop:** These days I work across marketing, finance, and AI. The accountant in me never left. It means every recommendation comes with the numbers to back it up. No hand-waving. No "trust me." Just evidence.

---

### Alternative L: The Contrarian
**Headline:** Forget Growth Hacks. Your Business Needs Growth Fundamentals.

**Lead:** Everyone wants the shortcut. The viral campaign. The AI tool that does everything. But after thirty years, I've learned that sustainable growth comes from boring things done well. Margins. Customer selection. Operational efficiency.

**Value Prop:** I help business owners get the fundamentals right. Marketing that targets the right people. Finances that reveal the truth. AI that saves time on work that shouldn't need humans. Not sexy. Extremely effective.

---

### Alternative M: The Specific Promise
**Headline:** Find Your Hidden Profit in 30 Days.

**Lead:** Every business has money leaking somewhere. Underpriced services. Overserviced customers. Marketing spend that feels productive but isn't. In thirty days, I'll show you exactly where yours is going and how to stop it.

**Value Prop:** This isn't theory. It's forensic analysis across your marketing, finances, and operations, using thirty years of pattern recognition. Most clients find the engagement pays for itself before it's finished.

---

### Alternative N: The Trusted Advisor
**Headline:** When You Can't Talk to Your Team, Talk to Me.

**Lead:** Some problems you can't discuss with employees. Concerns about the business model. Doubts about key people. Exit plans you're not ready to announce. You need someone outside the building who understands the inside.

**Value Prop:** I've been that person for dozens of business owners. Part strategist, part sounding board, part truth-teller. Marketing, finance, AI, governance... whatever you need to think through, I've probably seen it before.

---

### Alternative O: The Wake-Up Call
**Headline:** Your Competitors Are Using AI. Are You?

**Lead:** Not as a gimmick. As genuine infrastructure. They're automating customer service, generating content, analysing data, and making decisions faster than you. The gap is widening every month.

**Value Prop:** I help business owners catch up and pull ahead. Not with hype, but with practical AI that solves real problems. Built by someone who also understands marketing and finance, so the technology actually connects to business results.

---

### Alternative P: The Peer
**Headline:** Running a Business Is Lonely. It Doesn't Have to Be.

**Lead:** Your team looks to you for answers. Your board wants results. Your family wants you home. And somewhere in there, you're supposed to figure out strategy, marketing, technology, and a hundred other things you never trained for.

**Value Prop:** I work with business owners who want a thinking partner. Someone who's seen the problems before, can challenge your assumptions, and won't judge when you admit you don't know. Thirty years of experience, zero ego about sharing it.

---

### Alternative Q: The Mathematician
**Headline:** Growth Is a Maths Problem. I'm Good at Maths.

**Lead:** Customer acquisition cost. Lifetime value. Conversion rates. Margin by product line. Most business owners know these numbers vaguely. When you know them precisely, the right decisions become obvious.

**Value Prop:** I'm a Chartered Accountant who moved into marketing and AI. That unusual path means I can build your growth model, find the leverage points, and create systems that improve the numbers automatically. Less guessing. More growing.

---

### Alternative R: The Operator
**Headline:** I Don't Just Advise. I Build.

**Lead:** Strategy documents are easy. Implementation is hard. That's why I stay involved after the recommendations are made. Building the marketing systems. Deploying the AI agents. Sitting in the meetings where things actually happen.

**Value Prop:** Thirty years of operating experience across finance, marketing, and technology. I've done the work, not just talked about it. When I suggest something, it's because I've made it work before.

---

### Alternative S: The Simplifier
**Headline:** Business Doesn't Have to Be This Complicated.

**Lead:** Somewhere along the way, we convinced ourselves that growth requires complex funnels, enterprise software, and strategies nobody can remember. It doesn't. The best businesses I've worked with do simple things consistently well.

**Value Prop:** I help business owners cut through the noise. Find the two or three things that will actually move the needle. Build systems to do them reliably. Then get out of the way and let the results compound.

---

### Alternative T: The Pragmatist
**Headline:** Good Enough Today Beats Perfect Next Year.

**Lead:** I've watched too many businesses stall while waiting for the perfect strategy, the perfect hire, the perfect moment. Meanwhile, their competitors shipped something imperfect and learned from it.

**Value Prop:** My job is to help you move. Figure out what's good enough for now. Test it. Improve it. Keep momentum. Thirty years of marketing, finance, and AI experience means we rarely waste time on the wrong things.

---

### Alternative U: The Scale Partner
**Headline:** Ready to Scale? Let's Build the System.

**Lead:** You've proven the model works. Customers buy. Revenue grows. But scaling is a different game. What got you here won't get you there. You need strategy, systems, and someone who's done this before.

**Value Prop:** I help business owners scale smart. Proven marketing frameworks. AI that handles the repetitive work. Strategy that keeps the numbers healthy while you grow. Not theory from a textbook. Patterns that actually work.

---

### Alternative V: The Thinking Partner
**Headline:** You Don't Need Another Consultant. You Need a Thinking Partner.

**Lead:** Someone to stress-test your ideas before you commit. Someone who asks the questions your team won't. Someone who's scaled businesses before and knows where the traps are.

**Value Prop:** I work alongside business owners as a strategic partner. Marketing strategy. Smart automation. AI that frees up your time. And enough understanding of the numbers to know what's actually working. No jargon. No fluff. Just clear thinking when you need it.

---

### Alternative W: The Framework Guy
**Headline:** Stop Guessing. Start Using What Works.

**Lead:** Every successful scale-up I've seen runs on proven frameworks. Customer acquisition systems. Marketing strategies that compound. Automation that doesn't break. The businesses that struggle are the ones trying to invent everything from scratch.

**Value Prop:** I bring thirty years of frameworks that work. From DigitalMarketer strategies to AI automation playbooks. My job is to figure out which ones fit your situation and help you implement them properly. Faster results. Fewer expensive mistakes.

---

### Alternative X: The Clarity Maker
**Headline:** Clarity Is the Shortcut.

**Lead:** Most businesses don't have an effort problem. They have a clarity problem. Too many priorities. Too many tools. Too many tactics competing for attention. When everything matters, nothing gets done well.

**Value Prop:** I help business owners find the signal in the noise. The marketing strategy that fits. The automation that saves real time. The numbers that actually matter. Once you see clearly, the decisions get easier and the growth gets faster.

---

### Alternative Y: The Growth Architect
**Headline:** Growth Isn't an Accident. It's a System.

**Lead:** Some businesses scale smoothly. Others hit the same ceiling over and over. The difference isn't luck or talent. It's whether you've built the systems that make growth repeatable.

**Value Prop:** I help business owners design those systems. Marketing that brings the right customers. Automation that handles what humans shouldn't. Strategy that keeps everything pointing in the same direction. This is how you scale without burning out.

---

### Alternative Z: The Anti-Hustle
**Headline:** What If Growth Didn't Require Grinding Harder?

**Lead:** You've done the long hours. Worn the busy badge. But there's a ceiling to what hard work alone can achieve. At some point, you need smarter strategy, better systems, and leverage that doesn't depend on your personal energy.

**Value Prop:** I help business owners build that leverage. Marketing that works while you sleep. AI that handles tasks you shouldn't be doing. Strategy that multiplies your effort instead of just adding to it. Sustainable growth, not burnout.

---

### Alternative AA: The Straight Talk
**Headline:** Let's Figure Out What's Actually Holding You Back.

**Lead:** It's usually not what you think. Most business owners are working on the wrong problem because nobody's given them a straight answer. They're optimising marketing when the offer is wrong. Building funnels when the positioning is off.

**Value Prop:** I tell you what I see. Thirty years of pattern recognition, no agenda except getting you unstuck. Marketing strategy, automation, AI, understanding your numbers. Whatever the real blocker is, we find it and fix it.

---

### Alternative BB: The Builder's Mindset
**Headline:** I Help Owners Build Businesses That Scale.

**Lead:** Not just grow. Scale. The difference matters. Growth means more revenue. Scale means the business works better as it gets bigger. Systems get stronger. Margins stay healthy. You stop being the bottleneck.

**Value Prop:** Marketing strategy that compounds. AI and automation that multiply your capacity. Frameworks proven across dozens of businesses. And yes, understanding the numbers well enough to know what's actually working. That's how you build something that scales.

---

### Alternative CC: The Momentum Keeper
**Headline:** Growth Stalls When Complexity Wins.

**Lead:** Every scaling business hits the wall. Too many tools. Too many priorities. The thing that used to work stops working. Suddenly you're busier than ever but nothing's moving forward.

**Value Prop:** I help business owners cut through. Find the strategy that fits right now. Build automation that simplifies instead of complicates. Use AI where it actually helps. Keep momentum when everything wants to slow you down.

---

### Alternative DD: The Quiet Expert
**Headline:** I've Helped Dozens of Businesses Scale. Quietly.

**Lead:** No case studies with my name on them. No testimonials I can share. Just thirty years of sitting alongside business owners, solving problems, building systems, and watching them grow. The work speaks for itself.

**Value Prop:** Marketing strategy from DigitalMarketer frameworks. AI agents that handle real work. Automation that frees up your best people. And enough commercial sense to know what's worth doing. If you're serious about scaling, let's talk.

---

### Alternative EE: The Pattern Spotter
**Headline:** I've Seen Your Problem Before.

**Lead:** Not exactly, but close enough. After thirty years and dozens of businesses, the patterns repeat. The marketing that's not quite working. The automation that's half-built. The strategy that made sense two years ago but doesn't anymore.

**Value Prop:** Pattern recognition is the shortcut. I spot what's wrong faster because I've fixed it before. Then we use proven frameworks to build what works: marketing systems, AI automation, strategy that makes the numbers move. Less guessing. More growing.

---

### Alternative FF: The Multiplier
**Headline:** What If You Could 10x Your Output Without 10x Your Team?

**Lead:** That's what smart automation and AI actually deliver. Not marginal improvements. Step changes. The businesses scaling fastest right now aren't working harder. They're using leverage their competitors haven't figured out yet.

**Value Prop:** I help business owners find that leverage. Marketing automation that runs without you. AI that handles work you're paying humans too much for. Strategy that points everything in the right direction. This is how modern businesses scale.

---

### Alternative GG: The Integrator
**Headline:** Your Marketing and Your Strategy Should Be Talking to Each Other.

**Lead:** In most businesses, they're not. Marketing does its thing. Strategy lives in a document nobody reads. Automation runs in a corner. And the owner ties it all together manually, burning hours every week.

**Value Prop:** I help business owners connect the pieces. Marketing strategy that aligns with business goals. Automation and AI that execute consistently. Numbers that tell you what's actually happening. When it all works together, scaling gets simpler.

---

### Alternative HH: The Accelerator
**Headline:** You Know What Needs to Happen. You Need Help Making It Happen Faster.

**Lead:** Most business owners I work with aren't stuck for ideas. They're stuck for bandwidth. For expertise. For someone to help prioritise and execute without adding more to their plate.

**Value Prop:** That's what I do. Marketing strategy you can act on this week. AI and automation that free up your time, not consume it. Frameworks that skip the trial and error. Thirty years of knowing what works, applied to getting you moving faster.

---

### Alternative II: The Ally
**Headline:** Building a Business Is Hard. It Helps to Have Someone in Your Corner.

**Lead:** Someone who's been through the scaling challenges before. Who knows the marketing frameworks that work. Who can help you use AI without getting lost in the hype. Who understands the numbers without being boring about it.

**Value Prop:** I work with business owners who want a strategic ally. Not someone who tells you what to do, but someone who helps you think better, move faster, and build smarter. Marketing, automation, AI, strategy. Whatever you need to scale.

---

### Alternative JJ: The Leverage Finder
**Headline:** Every Business Has Hidden Leverage. Most Never Find It.

**Lead:** The marketing channel that could 3x if you fixed the messaging. The process that could run itself with the right automation. The AI application that would save ten hours a week. It's there. You just can't see it from the inside.

**Value Prop:** Fresh eyes plus proven frameworks. That's what I bring. DigitalMarketer strategies for customer acquisition. AI automation that handles real work. Enough pattern recognition to find your specific leverage points fast. Let's find what you're missing.

---

### Alternative KK: The Modern Advisor
**Headline:** Strategy Has Changed. Has Your Advisor?

**Lead:** The businesses winning right now use AI for more than chatbots. They automate more than email. They build marketing systems that compound, not campaigns that expire. Old-school advice won't cut it anymore.

**Value Prop:** I stay current so you don't have to. DigitalMarketer certified. MindStudio qualified AI developer. Thirty years of fundamentals plus whatever's working right now. Strategy and implementation for businesses that want to grow in 2025, not 2015.

---

### Alternative LL: The Simplicity Seeker
**Headline:** The Best Strategy Fits on One Page.

**Lead:** If your marketing plan needs a binder, it's too complicated. If your tech stack has more tools than team members, something's wrong. The businesses that scale fastest have figured out what to ignore.

**Value Prop:** I help business owners simplify. One marketing strategy that works. Automation that reduces moving parts. AI that consolidates instead of complicates. The numbers that matter, not the hundreds that don't. Simple scales. Complicated breaks.

---

### Alternative MM: The Results Partner
**Headline:** I Only Care About Results. Real Ones.

**Lead:** Not impressions. Not engagement. Not activity metrics that look good in reports. Revenue. Profit. Time saved. Problems solved. The things that actually change your business.

**Value Prop:** Thirty years has taught me to cut through the vanity metrics. Marketing strategy that drives customers who pay. Automation that saves hours, not minutes. AI that handles work nobody should be doing manually. Let's focus on what moves the needle.

---

## SERVICES SECTION HEADER

### Current Version
**Headline:** Six Ways to Work Together
**Subhead:** Pick what fits. Some clients need a strategist in their corner. Others want hands-on implementation. A few want both. Here's what I actually do.

---

**Headline:** What I Actually Do
**Subhead:** No mystery. No "it depends." Here are the six ways we can work together, with clear descriptions of each.

---

### Alternative B: Outcome-focused
**Headline:** Growth Comes in Different Shapes
**Subhead:** Some businesses need better marketing. Some need sharper strategy. Some need someone to sit on the board and ask hard questions. Figure out what you need, then let's talk.

---

### Alternative C: Conversational
**Headline:** Here's How I Can Help
**Subhead:** Not every business needs the same thing. Browse these six options and see which ones feel relevant. We can discuss the details later.

---

## SERVICES SECTION — COMPLETE (The Growth Architecture)

**Section Header**
**Headline:** How I Help
**Subhead:** The Growth Architecture
**Tagline:** *Six systems. One outcome: a business that scales without you.*

**Intro:** Most founders hit a ceiling because they're missing infrastructure, not effort. Here's what I build with business owners ready to break through.

---

### Marketing Strategy
*The engine that fills your pipeline.*

Random tactics burn cash. Systems compound. I design marketing infrastructure that brings qualified buyers to you predictably — built on frameworks proven across hundreds of businesses and three decades of what actually converts.

- Acquisition systems that run without you
- Funnels engineered to compound
- Positioning that repels the wrong buyers
- Metrics that expose the truth

---

### AI & Automation
*The multiplier that scales without headcount.*

Every hour your team spends on repeatable work is an hour stolen from growth. I build AI agents and automation systems that handle what humans shouldn't — freeing your people for the work that actually moves the needle.

- AI agents running in production (not experiments)
- Workflows that scale with volume
- Systems that learn and improve
- Integration with your existing stack

---

### Growth Strategy
*The roadmap that doesn't gather dust.*

Tactics without direction is expensive chaos. I help you define where you're going and align your marketing, operations, and team around getting there — with clear priorities that survive contact with reality.

- Strategic clarity for the next phase
- Focus that eliminates noise
- Roadmaps your team actually follows
- Exit planning when the time is right

---

### Fractional CMO
*The leadership without the overhead.*

You need marketing leadership, not another full-time salary. I embed with your team a few days a month — building systems, developing capability, and keeping momentum when you can't afford to stall.

- Part-time presence, full-time accountability
- Team capability that compounds
- Agency and vendor oversight
- Continuity through growth stages

---

### Non-Executive Director
*The challenge that keeps you honest.*

Governance isn't bureaucracy — it's protection. As you scale, you need someone on the board who understands growth but asks uncomfortable questions. Formally qualified. Operationally experienced. Invested in the outcome.

- Independent strategic challenge
- Governance that scales with you
- Risk awareness without paralysis
- Board experience that earns its seat

---

### Investment
*The capital that comes with capability.*

For the right business, I put money alongside time. Not passive capital waiting for returns — active partnership building the systems that drive growth. If you've got the fundamentals and need fuel plus expertise, let's talk.

- Capital with hands-on involvement
- Growth systems built together
- Incentives fully aligned
- Long-term partnership, not a transaction

---

## CTA SECTION

### Current Version
**Headline:** Curious? Let's Talk.
**Body:** You've read this far. That tells me something's not working the way you want it to. Maybe it's marketing. Maybe it's AI. Maybe it's the strategy itself. Book a call and we'll figure out if I can help. If not, I'll tell you that too.
**Note:** No sales pitch. Just an honest conversation about what you're trying to build.

---

### Alternative A: Low Pressure
**Headline:** Not Sure Yet? That's Fine.
**Body:** You don't need to know exactly what you want before we talk. Most people don't. Book a call and we'll spend 30 minutes figuring out if there's a fit. If not, no hard feelings.
**Note:** I'd rather tell you I can't help than waste both our time.

---

### Alternative B: Direct Value
**Headline:** Get a Second Opinion on Your Growth Strategy
**Body:** Book a 30-minute call. Tell me where you're stuck. I'll give you at least one idea you can use immediately, whether we work together or not. That's the deal.
**Note:** No obligation. No follow-up emails if you're not interested.

---

### Alternative C: Specific
**Headline:** Ready to Fix What's Broken?
**Body:** Pick a time that works. We'll talk about your business, your goals, and where you're getting stuck. By the end of the call, you'll know whether I can help and exactly how.
**Note:** Thirty minutes. No preparation needed. Just show up.

---

### Alternative D: Story-driven
**Headline:** Every Big Change Starts With a Conversation
**Body:** I've had hundreds of these calls over the years. Some turned into long partnerships. Some ended with a handshake and a referral to someone better suited. All of them were worth having.
**Note:** The only way to know if this works is to talk. Book a slot.

---

## DIFFERENTIATOR SECTION

### Current Version
**Headline:** What Makes This Different
**Lead:** Here's the problem with most consultants. They're specialists. Your marketing person doesn't understand your P&L. Your finance person thinks marketing is fluffy. Your tech advisor can't explain ROI to your board.

I never planned to work across all three disciplines. It just happened over thirty years of solving real problems. And it turns out that's exactly where the opportunities hide.

---

### Alternative A: The Contrast
**Headline:** Most Advisors See Half the Picture
**Lead:** Marketing consultants optimise campaigns without understanding margins. Finance people cut costs without understanding customer value. Tech consultants build systems nobody uses.

I've worked across all three for thirty years. Not because I planned it that way, but because real problems don't respect neat categories. The best solutions usually come from connecting dots that specialists never see.

---

### Alternative B: The Personal Story
**Headline:** How I Ended Up Doing All of This
**Lead:** I trained as an accountant at GSK. Got restless. Moved into marketing. Built agencies. Started investing. Along the way, I picked up AI because it was obviously going to change everything.

None of this was planned. But now I have this odd combination of skills that turns out to be exactly what growing businesses need: someone who can connect marketing to finance to technology, and explain the whole thing to a board.

---

### Alternative C: The Proof
**Headline:** Why This Combination Matters
**Lead:** Think about the last consultant you hired. They probably knew their specialty well. But could they explain how their recommendations would affect your bottom line? Could they tell you which customers to focus on? Could they build an AI system to automate the boring parts?

That's the gap I fill. Not because I'm smarter, but because I've spent thirty years collecting skills that most people keep separate.

---

## EXPERIENCE SECTION

### Current Version
**Headline:** Thirty Years of Getting Things Done
**Subhead:** Started at GlaxoSmithKline. Built agencies. Sat on boards. Invested in companies. The kind of experience that only comes from showing up and doing the work.

---

### Alternative A: The Resume Lite
**Headline:** The Short Version
**Subhead:** FTSE 100 finance at GSK. International agency work at TBWA. Multiple board roles. Active investments. Thirty years of figuring out what actually moves the needle.

---

### Alternative B: The Anti-Resume
**Headline:** I've Made Every Mistake Already
**Subhead:** Thirty years in business means thirty years of learning what doesn't work. GSK taught me rigour. TBWA taught me creativity. The rest taught me humility. Now I help others skip the expensive lessons.

---

### Alternative C: Conversational
**Headline:** Some Context
**Subhead:** I've been at this for thirty years. Big companies like GSK. Creative agencies like TBWA. Small businesses I've invested in. Boards where I've had to make real decisions. It all adds up.

---
